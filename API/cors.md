## Alternative way for setting up CORS mechanism
* For what I understood for now, browser has CORS rule. So front end and back end engineers are only try to pass the CORS rule whihc set by browser.

* Proxy Server
   * client browser ->  Proxy -> API Server
   * You only need to make sure CORS is implemented between browser and proxy.
