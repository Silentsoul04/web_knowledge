## Debugging
* cmd + opt + i
  * open inspector
* esc:
  * open console


## Coding Style
* The maximum line length should be agreed upon at the team-level. It’s usually 80 or 120 characters.
* Code First then helper function
* Must use semicolon all the time.

##  Comments
* self-descriptive
 * if you need to comment on a function to tell reader what is going on in the function, then don't do it. Just put all statements into a function can name the function correspondingly.
 * function tell you what is it for directly.

* What is good comment
 * Describe architecture of function rather than explanatory.
 * Explain why is the task solved by trick way.
 * If the code has anything subtle and counter-intuitive, it’s definitely worth commenting.

* Comment this:
  * Overall architecture, high-level view.
  * Function usage. (JSDoc)
  * Important solutions, especially when not immediately obvious.

* Avoid Comments
  * That tell “how code works” and “what it does”.
  * Put them only if it’s impossible to make the code so simple and self-descriptive that it doesn’t require those.

## Ninja Code
  * bad practice!!!!
