## Features of database
1. Massive
  * terabyte
2. Persistent
  * data reside forever
3. Safe
  * built-in mechanism to prevent it from malicious edition, or losing data
4. Multi-user
  * Multi-software use on same database.
  * concurrency access
    * multiple users use same database but works on different data items.
5. convenient
  * physical data independent
    * how data store is not related to how data layout
  * high-level query language -> declarative
    * you only need to command in human language no really need yo describe algorithm.

6. efficient
7. Reliable
  * system has to be up all the time.

## Key Concepts
1. Data Model
  * description of, in general, how the data is structured.
  * Example: set, XML, graph data.
2. Schema versus data
  * like types and variables.
  * schema === structure of Database
    * example: students with id, gpa....
  * data is just the value adhere to the schema
3. Data definition language (DDL)
  * higher level language to set up
a scheme or structure for a particular database.
4. Data manipulation or query language (DML)
  * QUERY AND MODIFYING DATABASE.

## Key People
1. DBMS implementer
  * people who create the system
2. Database designer
  * who establishes the schema for a database.
3. Database application developer
  * frontend developer
4. Database administrator

## Advantage over storing data in files
1. simple model
2. query with high-level language
3. efficient implementation

however, now hadoop is an good way to manage data in file system.
