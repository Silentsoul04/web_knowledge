## Decomposition
* mega relations
* decompose it
* do decomposition automatically

## Automatic Decomposition
* Mega relations + properties of data
* System decompose based on properties
* Final set of relations satisfies normal form



## Properties and Normal Forms
* Functional Dependencies -> Boyce Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
* Multivalued dependencies -> Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
* 4NF ⊆ BCNF ⊆ 3NF


### Functional Dependencies (Boyce Codd Normal Form/BCNF)
* Example: an student Ann apply to 7 colleges
 * Apply( SSN, sName, cName )
  * redundancy: update & deletion anomaly
  * same ssn and sName to 7 different tuples

* Functional Dependencies
 * social security number functionally determines the student name === social security always has the same name.
 * social security number to name as a functional dependency
 * SSN -> sName (one way direction)
  * every time we see 123 we see Ann, but not vice versa
 * should only store each SSN's sName only once.
 * BCNF: if A->B then A is a key.
  * we'll only have one tuple for each social security number.

### Boyce Codd Normal Form Requirement
 1. if the relations is third normal form and has no dependency, then it can be BCNF
 2. but if the relation has Functional dependencies: A -> B, then a has to be key to make the relation a BCNF

* Decompose
  * student(SSN, sName)
  * Apply(SSN, cName)

### Multivalued Dependencies and 4NF
 * example (SSN, cName, HS)
  * each tuple may have multiple combinations of cName and HS associate to single SSN.
  * SSN ->> cName, SSN ->>HS

 * Fourth Normal Form
  * A ->> B, A is key

 * decompose
  * Apply (SSN, cName), HighSchool (SSN, HS)


## Term
* normal form
  * no anomalies
  * no lost information
* key
  * just one tuple with each value for that attribute.
