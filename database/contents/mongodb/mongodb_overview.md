## MongoDB
* non-relational database
* data in documents
* all data in one record without any preset tables
* use of JSON as its document storage structure


### Benefit
* Scalability: by default, non-relational databases are split (or "shared") across many systems instead of only one. This makes it easier to improve performance at a lower cost.

* Flexibility: new datasets and properties can be added to a document without the need to make a new table for that data.
  * has no schema

* Replication: copies of the database run in parallel so if one goes down, one of the copies becomes the new primary data source.


## Mongoose
* is an npm module
* allows you to write objects for Mongo as you would in JavaScript
* make it easier to construct documents for storage in Mongo.
