# Intorduction to keys
* keys keep everything unique

## Keys
* **three main rules**
    * must be unique
    * never change
    * nver have null value


* user table
    * | username | first_name | last_name | pw | email |


### Natural Key
* a key that is actaully an attribute in table
* unique
    * email
        * if we assure that email service provider only issue one email to one person, then the email can be natural key
        * in our own service, only allow an unregistered email to register account


## Problems
* change the key
    * all tables that connect to the user table has to be changed
