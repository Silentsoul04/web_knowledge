## Network Layer
* It is Internet (Internet Protocol).
* Provide a service which includes the routing to the destination.

## IP Service Model
<img src="./assets/ip_service_model">

## Properties
1. datagram
2. unreliable
3. best effort
4. Connectionless (no order)


### Datagram
| data | IP SA | IP DA |
* IP SA: IP source addresss
* IP DA: IP destination address
* Router will forward datagram by its forwarding table
 * it dose not know the whole path, just use the IP DA to index the forwarding table to find the next router. (hop by hop)

 ### Unreliable
 * No promise that packets will be delivered
   * late
   * out of sequence
   * never delivered
   * packet may be duplicated

### Beset Effort
 1. Drop
   * IP do not drop datagram arbitrarily
   * Drop Scenario
    * packet queue in a router has congestion, which forcing the router to drop the next arriving packet.
   * Don't resend data and do not inform sender (end-host) that the datagram is dropped.
 2. Faulty Routing
   * send packet to wrong destination
   * duplicate packet by mistake

### Connectionless
 * No order for packets

## Why is the IP service so simple ?
1. Simple, dumb, minimal: Faster, more streamlined and lower cost to build and maintain.
 * A lot of routers scatter over the world, it should not be updated often.
 * Just for data delivery.

2. The end-to-end principle: Where possible, implement features in the end hosts.
 * Easy to evolve and improve.
 * In the case of the Internet, it was decided that features such as reliable
communications and controlling congestion should be done at the end points â€“ by the
source and destination computers.

3. Allows a variety of reliable (or unreliable) services to be built on top.
 * Example: real time chat app (skype), if IP retransmit some dropped datagram, the datagram will be useless because it is not real time. The skype may just want to put blank pixel or use the pixels from previous frame.

4. Works over any link layer: IP makes very few assumptions about the link layer below.


## The IP Service Model (Details)
1. Tries to prevent packets looping forever.
 * how does it happen: Forwarding table or router are changing
 * how to prevent: datagram header has hop-count field which called TimeToLive (TTL) field. It start out a number like 128 and is decremented by every router it passes. If it reaches zero, IP catch it and delete it.

2. Will fragment packets if they are too long.
