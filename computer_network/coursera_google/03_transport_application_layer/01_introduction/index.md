## Review
* first three layer
  * nodes communicate with each other in same network (LAN)
  * nodes communicate with each other in different networks (LAN) -> (WAN)
* first three layers are only for node to node communication

## what Transport and Application Layer for
* let programs on computer communicate with each other
  * solution: transport + application layer

#### Transport Layer
* allows traffic to be directed to specific network applications.

#### Application Layer
* allows applications to communicate in a way they understand.

## Course Goal
* TCP ports
* sockets
* different components of TCP header
* show the difference between connection oriented, and connection lists protocols
* how TCP is used to ensure data integrity
