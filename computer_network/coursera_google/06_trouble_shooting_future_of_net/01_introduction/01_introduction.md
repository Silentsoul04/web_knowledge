## Overview
* Many of the protocols and devices we've covered have built-in functionalities to help protect against some of these issues
  1. error-detection
    *  is the ability for a protocol or program to determine that something went wrong
  2. error-recovery
    *  is the ability for a protocol or program to attempt to fix it
  * example
    * **cyclical redundancy checks**
      * used by multiple layers to make sure that the correct data was received by the receiving end. If a CRC value doesn't match the data payload, the data is discarded. At that point, the transport layer will decide if the data needs to be reset

* Possible causes of error
  * Misconfigurations occur
  * hardware breaks down and
  * system incompatibilities

* goal
  * troubleshoots different network issues
    * mac
    * windows
    * linux
  * learners future of networking: the cloud and IPv 6
