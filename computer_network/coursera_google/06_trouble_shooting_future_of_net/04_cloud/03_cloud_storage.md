## Problems without Cloud Storage
* there's the general headache of managing a storage array. Hard drives are one of the most frequent components that may experience a malfunction in a computer system
* you'd have to carefully monitor the devices being used for storage and replace parts when needed


## cloud storage
* benefit
  * cloud storage providers usually operate in lots of different geographic regions
    * This let's you easily duplicate your data across multiple sites.
  * Many of these providers are even global in scale which lets you make your data more readily available for users all over the world
    * This also provides protection against data loss, since if one region of storage experience has problems, you can probably still access your data in a different region
  * flexible storage spaces with different prices
  * phone backup...
* downside
