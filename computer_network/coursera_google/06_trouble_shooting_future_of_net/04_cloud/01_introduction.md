## what is cloud
* cloud clients
* cloud storage
* cloud severs


## cloud computing
* is a concept
  * cloud computing is a technological approach where computing resources are provisioned in a shareable way so that lots of users get what they need when they need it
  * It's an approach that leans heavily on the idea that companies provide services for each other using these shared resources.
* technology
  * hardware virtualization
    * It allows the concept of a physical machine and a logical machine to be abstracted away from each other.


## Hardware virtualization
* a single physical machine called a host could run many individual virtual instances called guests (logical machine)
* hypervisor
  * Hardware virtualization platforms employ it.
  * is a piece of software that runs and manages virtual machines while also offering these guests a virtual operating platform that's indistinguishable from actual hardware

* a single physical computer can act as the host for many independent virtual instances. They each run their own independent operating system and, in many ways, are indistinguishable from the same operating systems running on physical hardware.

## Cloud Interconnected Machines

* a huge collection of interconnected servers that can host virtualized servers.
*  These virtual instances running on this collection of servers can be given access to the underlying RAM as they need it.


## Public Cloud v.s Private Cloud
*  In our analogy, we used an example of what a public cloud is, a large cluster of machines run by another company. A private cloud takes the same concepts, but instead, it's entirely used by a single large corporation and generally physically hosted on its own premises.

## hybrid cloud
* isn't really a separate concept. It's just a term used to describe situations where companies might run things like their most sensitive proprietary technologies on a private cloud while entrusting their less sensitive servers to a public cloud

## Conclusion
* Those are the basics of what the cloud is. It's a new model in computing where large clusters of machines let us use the total resources available in a better way. The cloud lets you provision a new server in a matter of moments and leverage lots of existing services instead of having to build your own. To sum up, its blue skies ahead for anyone using their cloud. Sorry, I couldn't resist.
