# Cable Broadband


## Overview
* all television broadcasts were wireless transmissions sent out by giant television towers and received by smaller antennas in people's homes
* Cable television developed for rural area
* cable broadband
  * coaxial cables + different frequency to transmit internet data
  * shared bandwidth technology




#### Shared Bandwidth Technology
* DSL, dial up
  * home devices(phone) -> Central Office -> other's home devices(phone)
  * caller -> central office -> callee
  * central office
    * used a switchboard to manually connect the caller with the callee
  * COs became smaller pieces of automated hardware that handled these functions for the telephone companies
  * benefit
    * Technologies that connect directly to a CO can guarantee a certain amount of bandwidth available over that connection since it's point to point
* Shared Bandwidth Technology (cable Internet)
  * many users share a certain amount of bandwidth until the transmissions reach the ISP's core network
  * Today, most cable operators have tried to upgrade their networks to the point that end users might not always notice the shared bandwidth.
    * But it's also still common to see cable Internet connections slow down during periods of heavy use. Like when lots of people in the same region are using their Internet connection at the same time.

#### CMTS

* Cable Internet connections are usually managed by what's known as a cable modem. This is a device that sits at the edge of a consumer's network and connects it to the cable modem termination system, or CMTS. The CMTS is what connects lots of different cable connections to an ISP's core network.
