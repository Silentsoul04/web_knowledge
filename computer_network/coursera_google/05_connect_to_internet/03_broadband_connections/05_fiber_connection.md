# Fiber Connection


## Overview
* higher speeds
* allows for transmission to travel much further without degradation of the signal
* use light for data transmission instead of electrical currents



## Fiver vs. Cable
* The absolute maximum distance
  * cable
    * electrical signal can travel across a copper cable before it degrades too much and requires a repeater is thousands of feet.
  * fiber
    * can travel many, many miles before a signal degrades.
* fiber is more expensive


## FTTX
  * Originally, fiber only exist in ISP core network
  * Goal
    * make fiber line closer to end user
  * Different kind of implementations
    1. FTTN
      * fiber to the neighborhood
      * fiber line connects to a single physical cabinet
        * The installation of optical fiber to a junction box (node) in a neighborhood that serves a few hundred customers within a radius of about a mile
      * From this cabinet, twisted pair copper or coax might be used for the last length of distance
    2. FTTB
      * names
        * Fiber to the building
        * fiber to the business
        * fiber to the basement
      * fiber technologies are used for data delivery to an individual building
      * After that, twisted pair copper is typically used to actually connect those inside of the building
    3. FTTH
      * fiber to the home
      * fiber runs to each individual residents in a neighborhood or apartment building
      * FTTH and FTTB may both also be referred to as FTTP
    4. FTTP
      * FTTH || FTTB
      * fiber to the premises

## Notes
* Instead of a modem, the demarcation point for fiber technologies is known as Optical Network Terminator, or ONT. An ONT converts data from protocols the fiber network can understand to those that are more traditional twisted pair copper networks can understand.
