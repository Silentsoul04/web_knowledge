# Digital Subscriber Lines


## Overview
* transfer data through public telephone network
* By operating at a frequency range that didn't interfere with normal phone calls, a technology known as digital subscriber line or DSL was able to send much more data across the wire than traditional dial-up technologies
  * normal voice phone calls and data transfer to occur at the same time on the same line
* DSLAMs or Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers.
  * a modem
  * establish data connections across phone lines
  * long-running connections
    * the connection is generally established when the DSLAM is powered on and isn't torn down until the DSLAM is powered off.



## ADSL && SDSL
* Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line.
  * different speeds for outbound (upload) and incoming (download) data
  * Generally, this means faster download speeds and slower upload speeds
  * often provide a similar user experience for a typical home user
  * lower cost
* SDSL
  * Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line
  * the same as ADSL except the upload and download speeds are the same
  * In old times, it is mainly used by businesses that hosted servers that needed to send data to clients
  * Now a days
    * lower cost
    * used in business or by home user.
  * speed
    * Most SDSL technologies and have an upper cap of 1.544 megabits a second or the same as a T1 line.
* HDSL or High Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Lines
  * These are DSL technologies that provision speeds above 1.544 megabits per second.
