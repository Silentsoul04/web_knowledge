# T Carrier Technologies
* First invented by AT&T
* a system that allowed lots of phone calls to travel across a single cable



#### Transmission System 1 (T1)
1. 24 simultaneous phone calls across a single piece of twisted pair copper
2. Each of the 24 phone channels was capable of transmitting data at 64 kilobits per second
  * making a single T1 line capable of transmitting data at 1.544 megabits per second
3. Over the years, the phrase T1 has come to mean any twisted-pair copper connection capable of speeds of 1.544 megabits per second even, if it doesn't strictly follow the original Transmission System 1 specification
4. originally for data transmission between telecom companies only
  * later on, in common business
5. T3 line is 28 T1s all multiplexed achieving a total throughput speed of 44.736 megabits per second
6. they've usually been surpassed by other broadband technologies
  * cable broadband or fiber connections (cheaper)
