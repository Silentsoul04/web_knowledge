# Cellular Network


## Overview
* in high level, it's just like 802.11
* has different cellular specifications
* operates over radio waves
  * there are specific frequency bands specifically reserved for cellular transmissions
    * these frequencies can travel over longer distances more easily, usually over many kilometers or miles


## Cells
* Cellular networks are built around the concept of cells
* Each cell is assigned a specific frequency band for use. Neighboring cells are set up to use bands that don't overlap
* the cell towers that broadcast and receive cellular transmissions can be thought of like access points, just with a much larger range
