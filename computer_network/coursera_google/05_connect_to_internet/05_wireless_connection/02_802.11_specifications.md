* most common specifications: b, a, g, n and ac
  * same
    * how it works with data link layer
  * difference
    * physical layer
      * have different ranges
      * different modulation techniques
      * different transmission bit rates
      * operate on different frequency bands
  * difference in detail
    * The most important thing to remember is that networks that operate on the 5Ghz band are almost always faster, but have less of a range. Most of the 2.4Ghz networks are slightly slower and more susceptible to interference, but usually cover a larger area.
