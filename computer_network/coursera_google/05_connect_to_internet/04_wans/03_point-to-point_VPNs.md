# Point to Point VPNs

## Overview
* Now a day, it is an alternative to WAN
* reason
  * cloud implementation becomes mature
   * history
      1. WAN for transporting internal data between different sites at different city/country...
      2. Move internal services into cloud
        * cloud lets companies outsource all or part of their different pieces of infrastructure to other companies to manage
        * example: email
          1. company runs their own email server
          2. have a cloud hosting provider host companies email server
          3. using email as a service provider, then you wouldn't have an email server at all anymore
            * you don't even own an email sever
      3. no need WAN anymore
        * compare to cloud service, renting private WAN is too expensive



## Point to Point VPNs
* Instead, companies can use point-to-point VPNs to make sure that there are different sites can still communicate with each other. A point-to-point VPN, also called a site-to-site VPN, establishes a VPN tunnel between two sites. This operates a lot like the way that a traditional VPN setup lets individual users act as if they are on the network they're connecting to. It's just that the VPN tunneling logic is handled by network devices at either side, so that users don't all have to establish their own connections. Now, it's time for one more quiz to see how your connections are firing.
