# Non-Routable Address Space

## Overview
* IPv4 standard doesn't have enough IP addresses available for every person on the planet.
  * 32-bit number
* The primary three ranges of non-routable address space
  * These ranges are free for anyone to use for their internal networks. It should be called out that interior gateway protocols will route these address spaces. So, they are appropriate for use within an autonomous system but exterior gateway protocols will not.  
  1. 10.0.0.0/8
  2. 172.16.0.0/12
  3. 192.168.0.0/16
