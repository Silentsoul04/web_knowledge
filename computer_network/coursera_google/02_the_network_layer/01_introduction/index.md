## Data Link Layer
* LAN
* single network segment

## Network Layer
*  allow data to cross many networks facilitating communications over great distances

## Goal
* IP addressing scheme
* how Subnetting works
* perform basic math in binary in order to describe subnets
* demonstrate how encapsulation works
* how protocols such as ARP allow different layers of the network to communicate.
* routing + routing protocols
