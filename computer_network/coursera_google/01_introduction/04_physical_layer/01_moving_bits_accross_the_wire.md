## Physical Layer
* consists of devices and means of transmitting bits across computer networks.


## Bits
* is the smallest representation of data that a computer can understand.
  * 1 or 0

## Copper Cable
* carry a constant electrical charge
* Ones and zeros are sent across those network cables through a process called modulation.


## Modulation
* Modulation is the process of modifying one or more parameters of a base communications signal such as amplitude, frequency, phase, angle or simply the presence and absence of the signal, for the purpose of encoding information into the signal and transmitting it to a destination.

* is a way of varying the voltage of this charge moving across the cable.

* human voice
  * low frequency
  * transmission distance: short

* electromagnetic
  * high frequency
  * transmission distance: longer

* modulation
  * transfer human voice to electromagnetic -> increase the frequency so the signal can be transfered to longer place without distortion.


## line coding
* specific modulation for computer networking
* It allows devices on either end of a link to understand that an electrical charge in a certain state is a zero, and in another state is a one.
