## Cables
* connect different devices to each other allowing data to be transmitted over them.
* two main categories
  * copper
    * sender: send different voltage to create 1 and 0
    * receiver: receive different voltages and interpret to 1 and 0
  * fiber

### Copper
  * The most common forms of copper twisted pair cables used in networking are Cat5, Cat5e, and Cat6 cables. (category 5, 5e, 6)
  * how the twisted pairs are arranged, can have two major influence
    * how quickly data can be sent
    * how resistant these signals are to outside interference.
  * Cat5 is obsolete
    * it has crosstalk problem
    * Crosstalk is when an electrical pulse on one wire is accidentally detected on another wire.
      * electromagnetic interference
  * Cat5e reduce crosstalk, so reduce the amount of number of re-transmitting data.
  * Cat6
    * benefits
      * reduce more crosstalk
      * transfer data faster
      * more reliable
    * downside
      * more expensive
      * shorter maximum distance when used at higher speeds.

### Fiber
  * overview
    * contain individual optical fibers which are tiny tubes made out of glass about the width of a human hair
    * These tubes of glass can transport beams of light
    * use pulses of light to represent the ones and zeros of the underlying data
  * pros
    * good at resist influence from electromagnetic interference from outside sources
    * generally, transfer data faster than copper
    * transfer data in longer distance without data lost.
  * cons
    * more expensive than copper
