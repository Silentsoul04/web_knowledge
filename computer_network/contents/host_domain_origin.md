## Web Hosting
* Just like the house
* Server that contain resources



## HostName vs. DomainName


### HostName
* name of the host (machine/server)
* end-point


### Domain
* name of the network


### Explanation
* `hostname.domain.com`
* example `mymachine.theuniversity.org`
  * access from outside of the university network
    * domain -> host.to get data
  * access from inside of the university network
    * only need hostName to get data

## Why hostName and DomainName used Interchangably
* domain registration and web hosting services are often offered by the same provider.

  * domainName
