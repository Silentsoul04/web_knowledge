# Render Props

## Prerequisite
### Inline Function

## Why You Need It


## Prominent Projects that Implement Render-Props
### React Router
#### Problem
Say if you want to pass props to component rendered by React Router, you may write inline function to pass props to the component. But this will cause unnecessary remounting.

#### Solution
Use **Render-Props** to pass props to component and also prevent unnecessary remounting of component.
