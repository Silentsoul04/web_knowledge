1. Software as a Service
2. Platform as a Service
3. Infrastructure as a Service

#### Compute Engine vs. Kubernetes Engine
* Compute Engine
  * just infrastructure system which you get an virtual machine
* Kubernetes Engine
  * based on Computer Engine
  * container based (for docker)

## APP Engine V.S Compute Engine
#### App Engine
* Platform-as-a-Service
* simply deploy your code, platform does everything else for you.
* automatically create more instances to handle the increased volume
* downsides
  * not customized

#### Computer Engine
* Infrastructure-as-a-Service.
* flexible
* You have to create and configure your own virtual machine instances
* downsides
  * you have to manage your app and virtual machines yourself.

## Serverless Architecture

##### Google Cloud Services
* app engine
* cloud engine

## Node.js
https://cloud.google.com/nodejs/


## Mongo

* https://cloud.mongodb.com/user

## [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Terms
* cloud shell
  * gcloud
  * a built-in command-line tool for the google console
* 


# Amazon

## serverless Architecture
*  build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure
* Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is
* You no longer have to provision, scale, and maintain servers to run your applications, databases, and storage systems

#### Benefit
* focus on core product
* no need to worry anything about servers
  1. management
  2. operation
  3. runtimes
