* HtmlWebpackPlugin
  * problem: you have an index.html file in dist folder
    * the index.html includes several bundle files.
    * if you change the bundle's name, you have to change the path in index.html manually.
  * solution:
    * HtmlWebpackPlugin generate the index.html file for you.
  * [note](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/362):
    * Note that using contentBase when you're using html-webpack-plugin has no effect. contentBase is meant to serve static files in the given path. The index.html generated by html-webpack-plugin is not static, it's compiled by webpack.

* html-webpack-template
  * has extra features to complement HtmlWebpackPlugin


* clean-webpack-plugin
 * clean dist folder in each build process
